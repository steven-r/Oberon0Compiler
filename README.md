An implementation of N. Wirths Oberon 0 language implemented with C# and LLPG. 
The aim is to support both, the RISC instruction set by N. Wirth and MSIL.

The compiler is based on the LLLPG parser.

Currently the status is pre-alpha conisting of a library containing the compiler and a unit test library.
